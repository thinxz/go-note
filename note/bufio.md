// Calling Peek prevents a UnreadByte or UnreadRune call from succeeding

func (b *Reader) Discard(n int) (discarded int, err error)

// Read reads data into p.

// of the line. The returned buffer is only valid until the next call to
// ReadLine. ReadLine either returns a non-nil line or it returns an error,
// never both.
//
// The text returned from ReadLine does not include the line end ("\r\n" or "\n").
// No indication or error is given if the input ends without a final line end.

// ReadBytes reads until the first occurrence of delim in the input,
// returning a slice containing the data up to and including the delimiter.
// If ReadBytes encounters an error before finding a delimiter,
// it returns the data read before the error and the error itself (often io.EOF).
// ReadBytes returns err != nil if and only if the returned data does not end in

// For simple uses, a Scanner may be more convenient.

// For simple uses, a Scanner may be more convenient.

``` [bufio / scan]

// Scanner provides a convenient interface for reading data such as
// a file of newline-delimited lines of text. Successive calls to
// the Scan method will step through the 'tokens' of a file, skipping
// the bytes between the tokens. The specification of a token is
// defined by a split function of type SplitFunc; the default split
// function breaks the input into lines with line termination stripped. Split
// functions are defined in this package for scanning a file into
// lines, bytes, UTF-8-encoded runes, and space-delimited words. The
// client may instead provide a custom split function.
//
// Scanning stops unrecoverably at EOF, the first I/O error, or a token too
// large to fit in the buffer. When a scan stops, the reader may have
// advanced arbitrarily far past the last token. Programs that need more
// control over error handling or large tokens, or must run sequential scans
// on a reader, should use bufio.Reader instead.
//

	r            io.Reader // The reader provided by the client.
	split        SplitFunc // The function to split the tokens.

}

// SplitFunc is the signature of the split function used to tokenize the
// input. The arguments are an initial substring of the remaining unprocessed
// data and a flag, atEOF, that reports whether the Reader has no more data
// to give. The return values are the number of bytes to advance the input
// and the next token to return to the user, if any, plus an error, if any.
//
// Scanning stops if the function returns an error, in which case some of
// the input may be discarded.
//
// Otherwise, the Scanner advances the input. If the token is not nil,
// the Scanner returns it to the user. If the token is nil, the
// Scanner reads more data and continues scanning; if there is no more
// data--if atEOF was true--the Scanner returns. If the data does not
// yet hold a complete token, for instance if it has no newline while
// scanning lines, a SplitFunc can return (0, nil, nil) to signal the
// Scanner to read more data into the slice and try again with a
// longer slice starting at the same point in the input.
//
// The function is never called with an empty data slice unless atEOF
// is true. If atEOF is true, however, data may be non-empty and,
// as always, holds unprocessed text.

// ErrFinalToken is a special sentinel error value. It is intended to be
